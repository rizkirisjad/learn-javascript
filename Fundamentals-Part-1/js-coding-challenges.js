// Coding Challenge #1

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).

// Your tasks:

// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

// Test data:
// § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.

//* Data 1:

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMImark = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
const BMIjohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
const markHigherBMI = BMImark > BMIjohn;

console.log(BMImark, BMIjohn, markHigherBMI);

//* Data 2:

const MassMark = 95;
const HeightMark = 1.88;
const MassJohn = 85;
const HeightJohn = 1.76;

const BMI_mark = MassMark / HeightMark ** 2;
const BMI_john = MassJohn / (HeightJohn * HeightJohn);
const MarkHigherBMI = BMI_mark > BMI_john;

console.log(BMI_mark, BMI_john, MarkHigherBMI);

/* Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement 😉 */

//* Data 1
if (BMImark > BMIjohn) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${BMImark}) is higher than John's (${BMIjohn}) !`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI (${BMIjohn}) is higher than Mark's (${BMImark}) !`);
}

//* Data 2
if (BMI_mark > BMI_john) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${BMI_mark}) is higher than John's (${BMI_john}) !`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI (${BMI_john}) is higher than Mark's (${BMI_mark}) !`);

// Coding Challenge #3

// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
// other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
// and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
// as well (draw means they have the same average score)
// 3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
// score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
// score, as well as multiple else-if blocks 😉
// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
// both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
// points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy

// Test data:
// § Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// § Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
// § Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

// const scoreDolphins = (96 + 108 + 89) / 3;
// const scoreKoalas = (88 + 91 + 110) / 3;
// console.log(scoreDolphins, scoreKoalas);

// if (scoreDolphins > scoreKoalas) {
//   console.log('Dolphins win the trophy');
// } else if (scoreKoalas > scoreDolphins) {
//   console.log('Koalas win the trophy');
// } else if (scoreDolphins === scoreKoalas) {
//   console.log('Both win the trophy');
// }

// Bonus 1
const scoreDolphins = (97 + 112 + 101) / 3;
const scoreKoalas = (109 + 95 + 123) / 3;
console.log(scoreDolphins, scoreKoalas);

if (scoreDolphins > scoreKoalas && scoreDolphins >= 100) {
  console.log('Dolphins win the trophy');
} else if (scoreKoalas > scoreDolphins && scoreKoalas >= 100) {
  console.log('Koalas win the trophy');
} else if (
  scoreDolphins === scoreKoalas &&
  scoreDolphins >= 100 &&
  scoreKoalas >= 100
) {

// Coding Challenge #4

// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
// restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
// 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for
// this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅 (If it's easier for you, you can
// start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
// operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
// (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
// 316.25”
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
// Hints:
// § To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
// § Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 😉

const bill = 275;
const tip = bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value
${bill + tip}`);
