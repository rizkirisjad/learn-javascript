// Coding Challenge #1

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).

// Your tasks:

// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

// Test data:
// Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.

//* Data 1:

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMImark = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
const BMIjohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);
const markHigherBMI = BMImark > BMIjohn;

console.log(BMImark, BMIjohn, markHigherBMI);

//* Data 2:

const MassMark = 95;
const HeightMark = 1.88;
const MassJohn = 85;
const HeightJohn = 1.76;

const BMI_mark = MassMark / HeightMark ** 2;
const BMI_john = MassJohn / (HeightJohn * HeightJohn);
const MarkHigherBMI = BMI_mark > BMI_john;

console.log(BMI_mark, BMI_john, MarkHigherBMI);

/* Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ */

//* Data 1
if (BMImark > BMIjohn) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${BMImark}) is higher than John's (${BMIjohn}) !`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI (${BMIjohn}) is higher than Mark's (${BMImark}) !`);
}

//* Data 2
if (BMI_mark > BMI_john) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${BMI_mark}) is higher than John's (${BMI_john}) !`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI (${BMI_john}) is higher than Mark's (${BMI_mark}) !`);
